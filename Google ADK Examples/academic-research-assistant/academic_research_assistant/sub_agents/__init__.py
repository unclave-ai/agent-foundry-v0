"""Sub-agents for the Academic Research Assistant.

This package contains the specialized sub-agents used by the Academic Research
Assistant to perform different aspects of the research workflow:

1. Profiler Agent: Analyzes researcher profiles to extract relevant keywords
2. Searcher Agent: Finds relevant academic papers using web browsing capabilities
3. Comparison Root Agent: Analyzes papers and generates insights by comparing them
   to the researcher's existing work

Each sub-agent is implemented as a separate module with its own agent definition,
prompt, and specialized tools as needed.
