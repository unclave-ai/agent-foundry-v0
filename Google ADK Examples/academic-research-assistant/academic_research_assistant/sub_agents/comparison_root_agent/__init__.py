"""Comparison Root Agent package.

This package contains the comparison root agent and its sub-agents, responsible
for analyzing academic papers in relation to a researcher's profile and generating
insightful comparisons and recommendations.

The agent serves as the final step in the Academic Research Assistant workflow,
taking inputs from previous agents and producing the final report for the user.

The agent uses a hierarchical structure with:
1. A root sequential agent that orchestrates the entire process
2. A loop agent that iterates between:
   a. An analysis generator agent that produces detailed paper comparisons
   b. An analysis critic agent that reviews and refines the generated analysis
3. A final formatter agent that prepares the approved analysis for presentation

Exported components:
    comparison_root_agent: The agent instance that can be used by the root agent
