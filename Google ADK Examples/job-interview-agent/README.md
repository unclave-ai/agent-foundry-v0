## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Microphone and speakers for voice interaction
- Google account (for Calendar integration - optional)

### 1. Setup Project

```bash
# Navigate to the job interview agent directory
cd job-interview-agent

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Setup Gemini API Key

2. Get your Gemini API key from the [API Keys section](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikeys)
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 3. Setup Google Calendar Integration (Optional)

#### Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Calendar API:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
