**1. Introduction to LangChain:**

**What is LangChain?**
LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides standardized interfaces, modular components, and pre-built chains for various tasks.

**Value Propositions of LangChain:**
- **Components:** Modular, ready-to-use building blocks for language model applications.
- **Chains:** Structured combinations of components to solve specific tasks.
- **Customizability:** Chains are customizable to cater to unique use cases.

**Applications of LangChain:**
- Document analysis and summarization.
- Natural language understanding and generation.
- Chatbots for customer support and information retrieval.
- Code analysis for bugs and security.
- Answering questions using diverse sources (text, code, data).
- Data augmentation for machine learning.
- Language translation and text classification.

**2. Key Concepts of LangChain:**

**Components:**
Components in LangChain are modular building blocks used to create language model applications. They include LLM wrappers, prompt templates, and indexes for relevant information retrieval.

**Chains:**
Chains combine multiple components to achieve specific tasks. Chains enhance modularity, simplification, debugging, and maintenance in application development.

**Agents:**
Agents enable LLMs to interact with their environment. They allow LLMs to perform actions using external APIs and integrate with external tools and data sources.

**3. Getting Started: Building a Simple Application**

Installation
To install LangChain run:

Pip
pip install langchain

Conda
conda install langchain -c conda-forge

For more details, see our Installation guide.

Environment setup
Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we'll use OpenAI's model APIs.

First we'll need to install their Python package:

pip install openai

Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."

If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:

from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key="...")

**Code Example:**
```python
# Import LangChain and initialize LLM
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
 
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, openai_api_key=api_key)

# Predict with the LLM
response = llm.predict("Suggest me a skill that is in demand?")
print(response)
```

**Output:**
```
One skill in demand right now is software/web development, which includes everything from coding to content management systems to web design...
```

**4. Understanding Components**

**LLM Wrappers:**
LLM wrappers provide standardized interfaces for working with different language models. They offer methods to predict text and messages using the model.

**Prompt Templates:**
Prompt templates structure input for LLMs. They allow easy formatting of user inputs and instructions for generating responses.

**Indexes:**
Indexes facilitate information retrieval from external sources. They help LLMs fetch relevant data to enhance response quality.

**5. Building an application
Now we can start building our language model application. LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications. Modules can be used as stand-alones in simple applications and they can be combined for more complex use cases.

The core building block of LangChain applications is the LLMChain. This combines three things:

LLM: The language model is the core reasoning engine here. In order to work with LangChain, you need to understand the different types of language models and how to work with them.
Prompt Templates: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial.
Output Parsers: These translate the raw response from the LLM to a more workable format, making it easy to use the output downstream.
In this getting started guide we will cover those three components by themselves, and then cover the LLMChain which combines all of them. Understanding these concepts will set you up well for being able to use and customize LangChain applications. Most LangChain applications allow you to configure the LLM and/or the prompt used, so knowing how to take advantage of this will be a big enabler.

LLMs
There are two types of language models, which in LangChain are called:

LLMs: this is a language model which takes a string as input and returns a string
ChatModels: this is a language model which takes a list of messages as input and returns a message
The input/output for LLMs is simple and easy to understand - a string. But what about ChatModels? The input there is a list of ChatMessages, and the output is a single ChatMessage. A ChatMessage has two required components:

content: This is the content of the message.
role: This is the role of the entity from which the ChatMessage is coming from.
LangChain provides several objects to easily distinguish between different roles:

HumanMessage: A ChatMessage coming from a human/user.
AIMessage: A ChatMessage coming from an AI/assistant.
SystemMessage: A ChatMessage coming from the system.
FunctionMessage: A ChatMessage coming from a function call.
If none of those roles sound right, there is also a ChatMessage class where you can specify the role manually. For more information on how to use these different messages most effectively, see our prompting guide.

LangChain exposes a standard interface for both, but it's useful to understand this difference in order to construct prompts for a given language model. The standard interface that LangChain exposes has two methods:

predict: Takes in a string, returns a string
predict_messages: Takes in a list of messages, returns a message.
Let's see how to work with these different types of models and these different types of inputs. First, let's import an LLM and a ChatModel.

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = OpenAI()
chat_model = ChatOpenAI()

llm.predict("hi!")
>>> "Hi"

chat_model.predict("hi!")
>>> "Hi"

The OpenAI and ChatOpenAI objects are basically just configuration objects. You can initialize them with parameters like temperature and others, and pass them around.

Next, let's use the predict method to run over a string input.

text = "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"

llm.predict(text)
# >> Feetful of Fun

chat_model.predict(text)
# >> Socks O'Color

Finally, let's use the predict_messages method to run over a list of messages.

from langchain.schema import HumanMessage

text = "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"
messages = [HumanMessage(content=text)]

llm.predict_messages(messages)
# >> Feetful of Fun

chat_model.predict_messages(messages)
# >> Socks O'Color

For both these methods, you can also pass in parameters as key word arguments. For example, you could pass in temperature=0 to adjust the temperature that is used from what the object was configured with. Whatever values are passed in during run time will always override what the object was configured with.

Prompt templates
Most LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand.

In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it'd be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product, without having to worry about giving the model instructions.

PromptTemplates help with exactly this! They bundle up all the logic for going from user input into a fully formatted prompt. This can start off very simple - for example, a prompt to produce the above string would just be:

from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?")
prompt.format(product="colorful socks")

What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?

However, the advantages of using these over raw string formatting are several. You can "partial" out variables - eg you can format only some of the variables at a time. You can compose them together, easily combining different templates into a single prompt. For explanations of these functionalities, see the section on prompts for more detail.

PromptTemplates can also be used to produce a list of messages. In this case, the prompt not only contains information about the content, but also each message (its role, its position in the list, etc) Here, what happens most often is a ChatPromptTemplate is a list of ChatMessageTemplates. Each ChatMessageTemplate contains instructions for how to format that ChatMessage - its role, and then also its content. Let's take a look at this below:

from langchain.prompts.chat import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)

template = "You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template = "{text}"
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])

chat_prompt.format_messages(input_language="English", output_language="French", text="I love programming.")


[
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.", additional_kwargs={}),
    HumanMessage(content="I love programming.")
]


ChatPromptTemplates can also include other things besides ChatMessageTemplates - see the section on prompts for more detail.

Output Parsers
OutputParsers convert the raw output of an LLM into a format that can be used downstream. There are few main type of OutputParsers, including:

Convert text from LLM -> structured information (eg JSON)
Convert a ChatMessage into just a string
Convert the extra information returned from a call besides the message (like OpenAI function invocation) into a string.
For full information on this, see the section on output parsers

In this getting started guide, we will write our own output parser - one that converts a comma separated list into a list.

from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser

class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser):
    """Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""


    def parse(self, text: str):
        """Parse the output of an LLM call."""
        return text.strip().split(", ")

CommaSeparatedListOutputParser().parse("hi, bye")
# >> ['hi', 'bye']

LLMChain
We can now combine all these into one chain. This chain will take input variables, pass those to a prompt template to create a prompt, pass the prompt to an LLM, and then pass the output through an (optional) output parser. This is a convenient way to bundle up a modular piece of logic. Let's see it in action!

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser

class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser):
    """Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""


    def parse(self, text: str):
        """Parse the output of an LLM call."""
        return text.strip().split(", ")

template = """You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists.
A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list.
ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template = "{text}"
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])
chain = LLMChain(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(),
    prompt=chat_prompt,
    output_parser=CommaSeparatedListOutputParser()
)
chain.run("colors")
# >> ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange']

**6. Agents: LLM Interaction with Environment**

**Code Example:**
```python
from langchain.agents import ExternalAPICall

class TranslatorAgent(ExternalAPICall):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(api_url="https://translation.api.com", method="POST")

    def perform_action(self, input_text):
        data = {"text": input_text, "target_language": "fr"}
        response = self.call_api(data)
        return response["translated_text"]

# Initialize the agent
translator_agent = TranslatorAgent()

# Perform translation
translated_text = translator_agent.perform_action("Hello, how are you?")
print(translated_text)
```

**Output:**
```
"Bonjour, comment ça va ?"
```
